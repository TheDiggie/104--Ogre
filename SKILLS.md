# SKILLS.md - the skills shelf (PORTABLE, part of the future-project kit)

PURPOSE: The skills shelf: catalogs each ritual, standup, checkpoint, ship,
  brief, runaway, preserve, intent, correct, as an invocable Claude Code
  skill in .claude/skills/, so a ritual runs from a script instead of from
  memory.
INTENT: Mazhron's ruling 2026-09-03: rituals that live only as law text get
  executed from memory; rituals that live as skills get executed from the
  script.

Founded 2026-09-03 on Mazhron's ruling: rituals that live only as law text
get executed from memory; rituals that live as SKILLS get executed from the
script. A skill is a markdown instruction pack in `.claude/skills/<name>/
SKILL.md`; typing `/<name>` in Claude Code loads it and Claude follows it.
Skills cost nothing at rest - they load only when invoked or clearly needed.

Search keys: skills, slash commands, rituals, plug and play, new project.
See also: SUBAGENT_METHOD.md (delegation the /brief skill enforces),
REPORTING_METHOD.md (the ledgers /standup and /checkpoint read/write),
WIKI_METHOD.md (the conventions every skill assumes), CLAUDE.md (the laws
the skills operationalize).

## The shelf (what each skill does)

- **/standup** - session opener. Runs the standup digest and hands back the
  last exchange (user's prompt + manager's response, both sides, VERBATIM -
  exact words, never paraphrased; mined from the HARNESS TRANSCRIPT, the
  ground-truth record on disk, so it survives a mid-arc /clear) and the
  project state before anything else, then THE BUDGET block (2026-09-10:
  yesterday's and today's weighted spend judged against the previous 7
  active days - a CHECK verdict is relayed verbatim, it names what went
  wrong). Use at every session start and after /clear.
- **/checkpoint** - arc closer. Push, refresh the day file's WHERE WE LEFT
  OFF (both sides of the final exchange VERBATIM + state + next-likely;
  write the reply into the file, then send that exact text), reset the
  task counter, emit the safe-to-clear marker. Refuses mid-arc, with
  uncommitted work, or with a running employee.
- **/ship** - batch shipper. Player-readable commit, push, build zips
  (never deleting old ones), counter tick. Runs after every completed
  batch, unprompted.
- **/brief** - delegation composer. Builds a sub-agent brief per the
  delegation laws (stamp, self-contained context, token budget line,
  diff-only reporting), then verifies cheap and ledgers the outcome.
- **/runaway** - the fan-out guard's numbers, in the owner's hands
  (Mazhron's ask 2026-09-10). Prints every limit current vs default with
  its meaning (`--limits`), takes the owner's changes (`--set`, refusing
  a warn step above its halt), proves the guard still stands
  (`--selftest`), and commits `.claude/fanout_limits.json` - the tuned
  numbers travel with the repo and survive a kit graft. Only the owner
  invokes it to raise a limit; the manager never does on its own.
- **/preserve** - THE PRESERVATION LAW's front (Mazhron 2026-09-11: the
  law lived in prose plus three loose scripts). Takes a target and offers
  the three lawful moves in order: RETIRE a file (`tools/retire.py`, to
  _retired/, ledgered), SHELVE a wiki section (`tools/cold_shelf.py
  --move`, verbatim, stub + index), or - only when neither does the job -
  the DELETE GRANT: the ask naming the exact target and size, the owner's
  yes, the restatement, the second yes, all four recorded verbatim by
  `tools/delete_grant.py`, then the ONE command. Never invoked by an
  employee; never raises a limit or routes around the preserve guard.
- **/intent** - files the WHY of a ruling in Mazhron's own words (Mazhron
  2026-09-13: "there should be a record of that to compare vs my
  intent"). Asks "What was the intent?" when it is not already stated,
  files a dated ASKED/WHY/GENERALIZES-TO/LIVES-IN section in INTENT.md,
  then resolves the open claim (`tools/intent_log.py --resolve ...
  --verdict same|similar|different`) so Claude's reading is measured
  against Mazhron's actual words. Never invoked by an employee.
- **/correct** - the correction ritual (Mazhron 2026-09-13's feedback-loop
  ask). Asks "What about the last thing I did needs correcting?", records
  Mazhron's words BEFORE fixing anything (`tools/correction_log.py
  --record`, which resolves the matching intent claim DIFFERENT by
  itself), fires /intent's "what was the intent?" question while the
  mismatch is fresh, then fixes and logs `--fixed`. /intent and /correct
  form one loop: a wrong build, the words that named it wrong, the why
  behind the right answer, the fix.
- **hooks** are the shelf's involuntary twin (HOOKS_METHOD.md, 2026-09-06):
  a skill runs when invoked; a hook runs when the harness reaches a moment.
  /standup now fires itself at session start, the checkpoint tick fires
  itself at every reply, and shell guards refuse what the laws forbid. A
  ritual that CAN be mechanical becomes a hook, not a longer skill.

- **/flag** - the purpose audit (Mazhron 2026-09-13: "Claude should
  always read-only -> Flag -> Explain"). One kit thing at a time: read it
  without editing, compare what its PURPOSE line says with what it does,
  color it GREEN (does what it says, nothing more) / YELLOW (matches in
  substance, something is off) / RED (does what it does not say, or
  crosses a law - Mazhron sees it first), then file the entry with
  `tools/purpose_audit.py --flag` into the kit's FLAGS.md (SAYS / DOES /
  FLAG, hashed to the version reviewed, tallied at the top). Any Claude
  may flag; a missing header is rewritten by script afterwards, never by
  hand in the audit turn.

## THE SKILLS RULE (standing, Mazhron 2026-09-03)

When a ritual or law is BORN or AMENDED, its skill is added or updated IN
THE SAME BATCH - law text and skill never drift apart. And whenever a skill
changes, REFRESH its copy in the future-project kit folder ("Future Project
MDs/skills/" plus this file) in the same batch, like every other kit file.

## New-project bootstrap (plug and play)

THE MASTER SEQUENCE lives in the kit folder's front door: "0 - READ ME
FIRST, CLAUDE.md" (kit-folder-only file; a new project's Claude reads it
and installs the whole operating system in order: wiki -> reporting ->
delegation -> skills). Skills go LAST because they call the tools the
earlier steps build; each skill degrades gracefully by pointing at its
METHOD file when a tool is missing. Nothing in the skills is
Everwood-specific except named examples (marked "in Everwood").

## Change log

- 2026-09-03 WS1: shelf founded with /standup, /checkpoint, /ship, /brief;
  THE SKILLS RULE established; kit copies created.
- 2026-09-06 WS1: hooks founded as the involuntary twin; /standup,
  /checkpoint and /ship reworded hook-aware (no manual tick; reset last;
  standup not re-run when the SessionStart hook already injected it).
- 2026-09-10 WS1: /runaway added (kit v1.10) - the fan-out guard's
  limits shown and tuned at the owner's word, stored in a committed
  .claude/fanout_limits.json over the script's defaults.
- 2026-09-10 WS1 (evening): /standup relays THE BUDGET block (kit v1.12)
  - the usage sheet's daily line, each day vs the previous seven.
- 2026-09-10 WS1 (night): /checkpoint gains ADVISED MEANS DO IT (kit
  v1.13) - an advisory from the gauge or the counter is acted on at the
  end of that reply, unprompted; the owner simply /clears.
- 2026-09-10 WS1 (late): /brief gains THE PRESERVATION LINE (kit v1.14) -
  every employee brief carries the law that its work contains no
  deletion code and runs no delete command; an employee that needs a
  deletion stops and reports.
- 2026-09-11 WS1: /preserve added (kit v1.16) - the preservation law's
  conversational front: retire, shelve, or the twice-acknowledged delete
  grant, in that order. Same batch: the hygiene guard hook backs THE
  SKILLS RULE mechanically - editing a SKILL.md returns the kit-refresh
  line (copy + shelf entry + README) at the edit.
- 2026-09-13 (Mazhron's intent + correction ruling): /intent and /correct
  join the shelf - the why of every ruling in the owner's words, the
  correction ritual that records the words and asks for the intent at
  once; the intent log compares Claude's reading with the owner's
  (INTENT_METHOD.md).
- 2026-09-13 (kit v1.19): /flag joins the shelf - the purpose audit's
  ritual (read-only, flag green / yellow / red, explain, file in
  FLAGS.md). Nine skills. Every SKILL.md now carries the format header
  (PURPOSE / INTENT after the title) - the format guard blocks a skill
  edit without it.
