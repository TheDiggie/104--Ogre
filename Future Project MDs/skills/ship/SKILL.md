# /ship - the per-batch ship ritual

PURPOSE: Ship a completed batch: commit with a player-readable subject,
  push, and (in projects with builds) refresh build zips without deleting
  old ones.
INTENT: Mazhron 2026-09-04: Without my asking the changelog should be
  updated. The ritual runs every step, tests, version, commit, push, builds,
  kit sync, changelog, unprompted after each batch so nothing is forgotten.

Run after EVERY completed batch of work; the user should never have to ask.

1. Sanity: tests/checks relevant to the batch are green (trust the ledger -
   do not re-run identical green runs).
2. Version: `python tools/version_hint.py` prints the first-pass reading
   (none / patch / minor from what changed since the last bump; never
   major, that is the owner's call). Bump if the batch warrants it (MINOR for a notable batch, MAJOR
   for a core-pillar milestone) in the project's single version source.
3. Commit: subject = one-line player-readable hook (it becomes the public
   changelog); body = player-readable detail bullets, same voice. Follow the
   project's text doctrines (in Everwood: no em/en dashes in player-facing
   text, including commit subjects).
4. Push, then `python tools/backup_push.py` (THE LOCAL MIRROR: every
   branch and tag to the bare `backup` remote of this repo and the kit
   repo, on another drive, then THE BROWSABLE COPY: the working folder
   robocopied beside the mirror, add/update only; a missing remote or
   drive is a skip line).
5. Builds (projects that ship binaries): run the build script
   (`python tools/make_builds.py` in Everwood). NEVER delete older build
   zips - old versions are the "before" side of dev-log comparisons.
6. Kit sync (projects that publish a kit): if the batch touched any
   future-project-kit file, run the kit sync script (in Everwood:
   `python tools/sync_kit_repo.py` pushes the public Rootstock repo; it
   REFUSES while the README's version lags or the README parity lint
   fails - fix the README or the kit, never bypass).
7. The checkpoint counter ticks itself (Stop hook) - relay any warning
   the hook prints; never tick by hand (it double-counts). Hookless
   machines only: `python tools/checkpoint.py --tick`.

Changelog EXPORT ships with the batch, unprompted (user ruling
2026-09-04: "Without my asking the changelog should be updated").
In Everwood, make_builds.py runs the export itself; a batch that
ships WITHOUT a build runs `python tools/export_changelog.py` by
hand before the batch counts as done. (This reverses the old
"user-triggered" line - 0.99.2..0.99.9 piled up under it.)
