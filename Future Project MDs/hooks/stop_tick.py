"""Stop hook: the checkpoint counter ticks itself (Tier 1, #2).

Fires when the manager finishes a reply. It ticks ONLY when work happened
(HEAD moved or the working tree's status changed since the last Stop -
tools/checkpoint.py work_fingerprint), so a Q&A reply does not inflate the
count and 8/15 keep their meaning. Manual `--tick` is retired: ticking by
hand now double-counts.

Escalation, mechanical: ADVISED (8 tasks or <80% context) shows the user
a system message; URGENT (15 tasks or <30% context) REFUSES to end the
turn once - the reason lands in the manager's context, who relays it
verbatim and recommends /checkpoint. Re-blocks every 5 further tasks;
`stop_hook_active` guards against loops.

Since 2026-09-13 it is also THE FORMAT LAW's Stop twin: a turn that
leaves a safety hook unwired in .claude/settings.json is refused once
(tools/format_lint.py's SAFETY table), so a prompt that switched a guard
off cannot end quietly.

THE CHANGELOG WARNING (the CEO's ruling 2026-09-14): if tools/
.changelog_anchor exists and HEAD has moved past it, one context line is
added to whatever this hook already emits (or, if it would otherwise emit
nothing, its own systemMessage) naming how many commits are unexported.
Warn-only, never a refusal, and never repeated for the same commit count
in a session (docs/history/checkpoint_state.txt's hook state carries the
dedup key, same file the tick counter already uses). The count skips
commits whose subject starts with "changelog:" - the export's own commit
(the exporter filters them the same way), so a fresh export is silent
(the 2026-09-28 fix: it warned "1 commit" after every export). THE
WARNING IS A STEP (the CEO 2026-09-28, correction C0003: "A Warning from
the hook means do it, not relay the message for the user to do"): the
manager runs the export inside that reply; the line is worded as an
order to the manager, never as a note for the CEO.

THE CHECKPOINT NAMED CHECK (the CEO 2026-09-28, correction C0004, after a
reply closed with "a checkpoint and clear is the natural next step
whenever you want to stop": "If this is the case, you should have just
done a checkpoint. Any reference to a checkpoint from any valid source
should prompt you to do it."): the hook reads this turn's reply text from
the transcript (every assistant text block since the last typed prompt);
if it names a checkpoint as due (the word near next / natural / due /
advised / ready / time to / should / whenever) and does not carry the
safe-to-clear marker, the turn is refused once per prompt with CHECKPOINT
NAMED, and the manager makes the checkpoint before the reply ends. A
reply that made it ends with the marker and passes; a mention of the
counter or the state file alone never trips it.

THE PROPOSAL NAMED CHECK (the CEO 2026-09-29, correction C0005, after a
standup reply relayed "The systems audit is 14 days and 10 day files
overdue ... The standup digest is about 3.2k tokens and wants a trim" and
asked what to work on: "If an audit is required, and it can be done with
a sub-agent, or a script, it doesn't need my permission. Just do it. If
the standup digest requires a trim, it doesn't need my permission. Do
it."): the hook asks ledger_trends for the DO proposals that clear when
done (CLEARS: the systems audit, the README audit, the digest trim, a
stale loop group, dead wiki links, an unwritten lesson, stale intent
claims); if this turn's reply NAMES one of them (its words or its ledger
name) while its ledger still raises it, the turn is refused once per
prompt with PROPOSAL NAMED and the manager does it before the reply ends.
A reply that did it passes because the ledger no longer proposes; a reply
that never mentions it passes (mid-arc work is not held hostage).

PURPOSE: Stop hook that ticks the checkpoint counter only when work actually
  happened (HEAD moved or the tree changed since the last Stop), shows an
  advised system message at 8 tasks or under 80% context, refuses to end
  the turn once at 15 tasks or under 30% context (re-blocking every 5
  further tasks), refuses once when a safety hook has gone unwired in
  settings.json, warns once per unexported commit count when the
  changelog anchor has fallen behind HEAD, and since 2026-09-28 refuses
  once per prompt when the reply names a checkpoint as due without the
  safe-to-clear marker (the reply text read from the transcript), and
  since 2026-09-29 refuses once per prompt when the reply names a DO
  proposal that its ledger still raises (PROPOSAL NAMED).
INTENT: makes the checkpoint discipline mechanical rather than a reminder
  the manager can forget, makes the format law's safety wiring impossible
  to quietly drop by refusing to end a turn that broke it, and makes an
  unexported changelog visible without anyone having to remember to check.

Search keys: stop hook, auto tick, checkpoint counter, dire, block stop,
safety wiring, changelog warning, changelog anchor, checkpoint named,
reply names a checkpoint, proposal named, the proposal law, do not ask.
See also: tools/checkpoint.py (counter, fingerprint, --reset);
tools/export_changelog.py (the anchor file); .claude/skills/checkpoint
(the ritual the warning asks for); tools/lesson_log.py (the transcript
reader the named check borrows).
