"""Shared plumbing for THE HOOKS (the CEO's ask 2026-09-06: "are there any
hooks we could create and add to our workflows?").

A hook is a script the HARNESS runs at a fixed moment (session start,
prompt submit, before a tool call, when the manager stops, before a
compaction). It reads one JSON object on stdin and answers on stdout:
plain text or {"hookSpecificOutput": {"additionalContext": ...}} is
injected into the manager's context; a PreToolUse "deny" refuses the tool
call and feeds the reason back; a Stop "block" refuses to end the turn
once. Wiring lives in .claude/settings.json (checked in - travels to both
workstations). Everything here is import-only.

PURPOSE: Shared plumbing every hook imports: reads the harness's JSON from
  stdin, emits JSON back for deny, block or context decisions, and resolves
  the project version; import-only, no side effects on its own.
INTENT: are there any hooks we could create and add to our workflows?

Search keys: hooks, harness hooks, settings.json, hook input, deny, block.
See also: docs/systems/tooling.md (the hooks section); HOOKS_METHOD.md
(portable method); tools/checkpoint.py (the counter the Stop hook ticks).
