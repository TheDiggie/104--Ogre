"""SessionStart hook: run the standup digest and inject it (Tier 1, #1).

Fires on startup, resume, /clear and after a compaction. This is the end
of "after /clear the CEO has nothing": the digest (THE LAST EXCHANGE mined
from the harness transcript + state + roadmap + ledger tails) arrives in
the manager's context without anyone typing "standup".

Answers `--selftest` (house pattern: PASS/FAIL lines on the pure header
builder and the pure loop/size helpers, never a live standup.py run, a real
run_all.py session run, or a write to the real digest_size.txt ledger).

THE LOOP LAW (the CEO's ruling 2026-09-14, "any script that should be run
multiple times must be called by the main looping script"): before running
standup.py, this hook checks docs/history/loop_runs.txt (via
tools/run_all.py's `last_run("session")`) and runs `run_all.py session`
itself when the session group has not run yet today on this workstation -
so the regen/check/metrics habit no longer depends on anyone remembering to
run it by hand. A one-line "[loop] ..." note is prepended to the digest
either way; a loop failure never blocks the digest itself.

THE DIGEST SIZE (the CEO's ruling 2026-09-14, "measure the standup digest"):
every injected digest appends one line to docs/history/digest_size.txt
(bytes + a bytes/4 token estimate + the trigger) so digest bloat shows up
in a ledger instead of only being felt.

PURPOSE: SessionStart hook that runs tools/standup.py and injects its digest
  into the manager's context on startup, resume, /clear and after a
  compaction, with a header telling the manager not to re-run standup and
  how to relay the last exchange; also runs the session group itself when
  it has not run today (THE LOOP LAW) and ledgers the digest's byte size.
INTENT: closes the gap where after a /clear the manager has no memory of the
  session, by re-injecting the last exchange, state and roadmap tails
  automatically instead of relying on anyone remembering to run standup;
  and makes the session group's habitual run, and the digest's size,
  measured rather than assumed.

Search keys: session start hook, auto standup, resume after clear, compact,
loop law, session group, digest size.
