# Godot Field Notes

PURPOSE: Hard-won engine knowledge from building Everwood (Godot 4.4):
  rendering and performance costs, simulation architecture patterns,
  GDScript and API gotchas, and the measurement toolkit, written portably so
  it carries to future Godot projects.
INTENT: Everything in here was learned the expensive way, measured,
  debugged, or shipped around, so future work, this game or the next one,
  never pays for it twice.

Hard-won engine knowledge from building Everwood (Godot 4.4). Everything in
here was LEARNED THE EXPENSIVE WAY - measured, debugged, or shipped around -
so future work (this game or the next one) never pays for it twice. Portable
by design: nothing below depends on Everwood's code.

## Rendering and the 2D performance model
Tags: performance, gotchas | Renderer choice and per-item costs matter more than texture packing alone

- **GL Compatibility barely batches across canvas items.** Measured
  directly: forcing ONE texture onto ~5,700 sprites still produced ~2,400
  draw calls (~3 sprites per batch). A texture atlas bought only ~17% there.
  **Forward+ (Vulkan) has real 2D batching** - the same board dropped to
  ~520 calls, and the atlas multiplied its effect (3.7x under Forward+).
  If a 2D game has thousands of sprites, the renderer choice matters more
  than any texture arrangement.
- **You can split renderers per platform in one project:**
  `renderer/rendering_method="forward_plus"` with
  `renderer/rendering_method.web="gl_compatibility"` (and `.mobile`).
  Desktop gets Vulkan, the web export automatically keeps GL. Keep
  `config/features` renderer tag in sync.
- **Draw-call submission cost hides INSIDE TIME_PROCESS.** GL renders on
  the main thread within the process step, so no GDScript profiler line
  ever owns it. If your instrumented script costs sum to 15ms but
  TIME_PROCESS reads 50ms, the missing ~35ms is the renderer/driver.
- **Canvas item COUNT is its own cost, independent of batching**: roughly
  ~3us of main-thread processing per visible item per frame. 11,000 items
  on screen = ~30ms before a single pixel draws. Levers: cull sub-pixel
  decorations at far zoom, bake static content into chunk textures (see
  the soil pattern below), or MultiMesh.
- **Property setters are NOT free, even for unchanged values.** In Godot 4,
  `Sprite2D.flip_h`, `modulate`, and `z_index` setters trigger canvas
  redraws / RenderingServer calls without equality checks. A herd of 180
  idle creatures rewriting identical values 60x/s was a measured cost.
  On hot paths, guard every visual property write with `if new != old`.
- **`Label.text = same_string` still re-shapes the font.** Pooled floating
  text re-setting an identical string ~450x/s was a measured storm. Skip
  the assignment when the pooled node already wears that exact text.
- **CANVAS_ITEM_Z_MAX is 4096, and relative z STACKS.** A child at z 4090
  under a parent with any z silently overflows - the engine spams an error
  you only see on stderr. Leave generous headroom (we cap decor at ~3900).
- **Runtime texture atlas is easy and pipeline-free**: at load, collect
  every unique Texture2D (including procedurally generated ones a build-time
  packer could never see), shelf-pack into big `Image`s (2px padding,
  4096 max width for old web GPUs), `ImageTexture.create_from_image`, and
  swap each source for an `AtlasTexture` region. AtlasTexture is a drop-in
  Texture2D (get_width/height return the region), with ONE trap:
  **`AtlasTexture.get_image()` returns the WHOLE sheet**, so image-reading
  tools need a bypass lever.
- **Group atlases along the draw order.** Batches break when the texture
  changes along the z-sorted draw sequence - pack categories that draw
  adjacently into the same sheet, never split a category across sheets.

## Simulation architecture (the patterns that scaled)
Tags: architecture, performance | Pool objects, tick centrally in buckets, and let the grid be the spatial hash

- **Pool everything; never instantiate/queue_free during gameplay.** Pooled
  scenes implement pool_activate()/pool_reset(). Corollary trap:
  `is_instance_valid()` is TRUE for a pooled-and-recycled node - a stale
  reference points at a reused object. Guard cross-references with state
  flags, never validity alone.
- **No per-entity Timer or _process.** One central system ticks entities at
  a fixed rate split into buckets (each entity ticks every Nth tick with
  Nx dt). Smooth per-frame motion stays per-frame; hunger/growth/decay ride
  the slow tick.
- **Fixed-timestep accumulators NEED a catch-up cap** (`while accum >=
  interval` is a death spiral: a slow frame banks ticks, repaying them makes
  the next frame slower - we caught 28 ticks running in one frame). Cap at
  ~3 ticks/frame and DROP the remainder (`accum = fmod(accum, interval)`) -
  sim time stretches gracefully under load instead of killing the frame
  rate. **Scale the cap by Engine.time_scale** or your fast-forward setting
  silently under-delivers at low fps.
- **Stagger everything.** (1) Give each system's accumulator a different
  initial offset so they don't all fire the same frame. (2) If off-screen
  entities tick at half rate, alternate by ENTITY PARITY, not a global
  phase flag - a global flag makes every off-screen entity tick on the same
  cycle, producing a visible multi-second fps sawtooth (heavy cycle, light
  cycle). Even/odd stagger = same cadence per entity, flat load.
- **The grid IS the spatial hash.** A game on a cell grid needs no Area2D
  and no physics queries - "what am I standing on" is integer math, radius
  queries walk cells. We render 6,000+ interactive plants with zero physics.
- **Bake state into one texture** (the soil pattern): a whole 560x11 grid is
  ONE Image/ImageTexture (1px per cell, nearest filter, scaled up), painted
  per-cell only when a cell changes, uploaded per-row only when dirty. One
  draw call for the entire floor. The same idea extends to static flora
  chunks ("chunk baking") when item count becomes the ceiling.
- **Cache expensive AI scans WITH their misses.** The worst pathology was a
  starving animal rescanning a 441-cell radius every tick and finding
  nothing, forever. A short TTL memory (hit OR miss, ~2 ticks; shorter for
  chasers; cleared on panic) removed the cost without changing behavior.
  Likewise, an O(N^2) "is a predator near me" scan became O(N + K) by
  collecting the few predator positions once per tick.
- **Vision cones cost one dot product.** Directional senses (prey sees
  ~300 degrees, hunters ~200) add rich behavior for essentially free -
  cost lives in scan COUNT, not scan quality.
- **Engine.time_scale scales _process delta and timers** - a free sim-speed
  lever, with the catch-up-cap interaction above as its one trap.
- **No physics used? Drop `physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second` to 10.**
  Harmless. But do NOT trust `TIME_PHYSICS_PROCESS` to confirm anything -
  we measured ~11ms there with ZERO physics nodes, unmoved by the tick
  rate; the monitor apparently misattributes frame-pacing time.

## GDScript and API gotchas
Tags: gotchas | Godot 4 language and API traps that silently break code or drop behavior

- `-1 << 30` is a PARSE ERROR (negative shift operand). Use a plain literal
  sentinel.
- `var x := dict.get(...)` (inferred Variant) is a parse error in strict
  projects - write `var x: Variant = ...`.
- **Never call `Input.parse_input_event()` from inside input handling**
  (a pressed callback etc.) - the synthesized event is silently dropped.
  `call_deferred` it.
- **CanvasLayer is not a CanvasItem** - generic code reading `visible`
  across mixed node types should use `node.get("visible")`.
- **`load()` caches resources.** Mutating a loaded Image/Texture mutates it
  for EVERY user - a shared folder sprite resized "for one species" shrinks
  for all of them. `duplicate()` before editing.
- **Static vars survive scene reloads.** Any static flag a catastrophe or
  mode sets must be reset in the owning system's `_ready()`.
- **Autoloads process before the current scene** (tree order); among
  autoloads, project.godot order rules. Matters for anything that
  accumulates per-frame data across systems.
- Integer division truncates (`level / 4` on ints) - handy for banded
  curves, a bug when a refactor makes one side float.
- **Enum-typed exports serialize as text defaults in .tres parsing tools**:
  a .tres omits fields at default value, so external tools reading tres
  files must also parse the script's defaults - and an enum default reads
  as `Op.ADD`, not a number. Write explicit values in generated tres files.

## Files, editor, and project plumbing
Tags: gotchas, process | Editor, export, and tooling traps that cause silent failures

- **Hand-written .tscn typed node exports need the header attribute** or the
  export silently stays null:
  `[node ... node_paths=PackedStringArray("soil")]` + `soil = NodePath(...)`.
- **PowerShell `Set-Content`/redirects write a BOM** that Godot's .tres
  parser rejects (`Parse Error: Expected '['`). Worse, a BOM once entered
  project.godot as a garbage duplicate key and survived for weeks. Write
  engine files from tools that emit clean UTF-8.
- **New asset FOLDERS require a `--headless --import` pass** - the silent
  failure is flat colors and no .import files beside the PNGs.
- **Export presets are addressed BY NAME**: `--export-release "Web"` fails
  informatively only if you read stderr; check `export_presets.cfg` for the
  actual names.
- **`--quit-after N` counts FRAMES, not milliseconds** - and headless
  `--fixed-fps` runs as fast as the CPU allows, so N frames of simulated
  time can pass in seconds (or a "25 minute" mistake).

## Debugging and measurement (the toolkit that cracked the case)
Tags: process, performance | Instrument every frame and measure windowed, not just headless, to find real costs

- **Read stderr.** `2>$null` hid SCRIPT ERRORs for days: a totally silent
  test run almost always means a parse error upstream, not a hung test.
  Engine error spam (like the z overflow) is stderr-only.
- **A frame-time watchdog beats guessing**: an autoload that logs any frame
  over threshold with `Performance` monitors (draw calls, objects, nodes,
  orphans, memory) plus game context. Orphan/node growth = leak;
  draw-call explosion = render burst; high process with low draws = script.
- **A cost ledger names the culprit**: wrap every per-frame `_process` with
  usec timing reported to the watchdog (`rename body to _frame(), add a
  4-line wrapper`), print the top costs on each spike line, and compute
  `unaccounted = frame - process - physics` (that remainder is render).
  When everything is instrumented, whichever key dominates IS the answer.
- **Per-second RHYTHM lines catch what spike lines cannot**: one compact
  line per second (fps, worst frame, the second's summed top costs) makes
  multi-second waves - like the off-phase sawtooth - readable at a glance.
- **Measure draw calls in-game, windowed**
  (`Performance.RENDER_TOTAL_DRAW_CALLS_IN_FRAME`), and bisect by hiding
  layers (plants off, fx off, one-texture-for-everything...). The
  one-texture experiment is what proved the GL batching truth in minutes
  after days of atlas theory.
- **Headless benches cannot see the render side.** A sim that benches at
  1.5ms/frame can still play at 15fps - always pair a bench with a
  windowed measurement before concluding anything about frames.
- **Prove time-scaling claims with a truth test** (count real frames to a
  sim event at 1x vs 3x). Ours read ratio 2.98 and turned a "bug report"
  into two real findings elsewhere.
- **Visual regressions: capture a screenshot from the game itself**
  (`get_viewport().get_texture().get_image().save_png(...)`) behind an env
  var, and compare before/after. Cheap, scriptable, decisive (verified the
  atlas and the Forward+ switch render identically).

## Process habits that repeatedly paid off
Tags: process, lessons | Self-test everything, data-drive every number, and trust player reports

- Self-test everything behind env vars with one PASS/FAIL line; run tests
  headless before every commit. A parse error that reaches main costs more
  than every test run combined.
- Data-drive every number (resources, not code constants). Twice we had to
  migrate hardcoded systems (perm costs, then the whole eternal shop) into
  resources so tools could edit them - starting data-driven is free.
- Guard generated patches: bash heredocs collapse backslash-newline
  sequences inside embedded code, producing joined lines that sometimes
  still parse (worse than failing). Literal-string edit tools for any
  continuation-bearing code.
- Filter test output by the string the test ACTUALLY prints ("TOOLTEST
  water:" does not contain "TEST:").
- When a player reports something impossible ("hidden animals are not
  behind the brush"), believe them: the per-frame row sort was clobbering
  the z shift every frame. The report was exactly right.

## Volume sliders: never feed a raw 0-1 slider into linear_to_db
Tags: gotchas, lessons, design | A linear slider through linear_to_db is far too loud at the bottom; square it first (10% = -40 dB) or players hear 10% as 40%

`AudioServer.set_bus_volume_db(bus, linear_to_db(slider))` looks right and
is wrong: linear_to_db maps AMPLITUDE, and the ear hears loudness, which
halves roughly every -10 dB. So 10% = -20 dB = about a quarter of full
volume, 50% = -6 dB = barely quieter than max. Players who set every game
to 5-15% find the bottom of the slider useless. The fix is one line: raise
the slider fraction to a power before linear_to_db. Exponent 2 gives
10% = -40 dB, 50% = -12 dB, 70% = -6 dB, 100% = 0 dB, which is the range
most games live in; 3 is stronger still. Put the exponent on a const and
route EVERY bus through the same function, then assert the curve in a
self-test (the value 10% maps to), because nothing else catches it: the
bus exists, the stream plays, mute works, and it is still wrong.

## Window mode toggles: a screen-sized windowed window IS fullscreen to Godot on Windows
Tags: gotchas, lessons | If the OS window exactly covers the screen, Godot/Windows gives it the frameless popup style and reads the mode back as fullscreen; set a window-size override smaller than the screen, and keep the chosen mode as your own state

Two bugs, one cause, found by measuring the real Win32 style word from
outside the game (a probe script reading GetWindowLong GWL_STYLE while
the game walks the modes on a timer - the only honest way to test window
chrome; headless has no window). A windowed window whose rect exactly
covers the screen gets WS_POPUP|WS_BORDER (no caption, no frame, no X or
minimize) and `Window.mode` reads back MODE_FULLSCREEN even though you
set MODE_WINDOWED. A project whose viewport size equals the dev screen
(1920x1080) hits this on every drop to windowed. Consequences: (1) an F11
toggle written as "if mode == FULLSCREEN then windowed else fullscreen"
sticks - the read-back says fullscreen forever; (2) "windowed" has no
title bar. What does NOT fix it (all measured): resizing the window after
the mode change, deferred or not; flipping `borderless` on and off. What
does: `display/window/size/window_width_override` / `height_override`
smaller than the screen (1600x900 for a 1920x1080 design viewport) - the
viewport keeps its design size under the stretch mode, only the OS window
shrinks. Plus the state rule: hold the DESIRED mode in your settings,
persist it, have every entry point (menu row, hotkey) flip that state and
apply it; the hotkey goes in an autoload's _input so no Control swallows
it and it works on menus and while paused. Names players expect:
Borderless fullscreen = MODE_FULLSCREEN, Exclusive = MODE_EXCLUSIVE_
FULLSCREEN, Windowed = MODE_WINDOWED. Remaining limit: screens no larger
than the override still hit the popup case.
Probe gotchas: the console exe is a WRAPPER (the game is a child process,
its pid never matches); with stdout PIPED the wrapper never shows the game
window at all (log to a file instead); a from-source run titles its window
"<name> (DEBUG)"; sample after the game's own log marker, never by wall
clock (boot time varies 2-4 s).
