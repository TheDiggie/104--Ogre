"""THE STANDUP DIGEST (TOKEN_IDEAS idea 7, APPROVED by the CEO 2026-09-02:
"this goes along with my rules of creating a script for everything").

Replaces the manager reading every handoff note and changelog wholesale after
a pull: prints a ~20-line digest - recent commits, the newest WS-note
headlines, the tail of every history ledger, and the open roadmap index. The
manager reads THIS, then opens full notes only where the digest points.

Usage:  python tools/standup.py [--commits N] [--no-usage] [--selftest]   (default 5)

THE DIGEST DIET (the CEO 2026-09-14, "the most important pieces are context
and efficiency. As long as there is no loss there, I'm happy"): the digest
is the largest fixed load at session start, so it prints only what the
manager acts on. THE LOSS TEST: a line leaves the digest only when it is a
duplicate of another block, or carries no verdict and is one `tail -1`
away by a path the digest already prints. THE LAST EXCHANGE and WHERE WE
LEFT OFF are never cut. LEDGER TAILS prints a ledger's newest line in full
only when it carries a verdict (CHECK, FAIL, RED, STALE, WARN, UNSYNCED,
a cliff) or is newer than the previous standup (digest_size.txt's last
line); the rest collapse to name + date on shared lines; ledgers another
block already shows are skipped. Commits default to 5; RECENT DAYS prints
each day's first clause.

THE BUDGET (the CEO 2026-09-10, TOKEN_IDEAS 20): the digest refreshes the
usage sheet silently (tools/usage_report.py --quiet, incremental, ~2 s)
and prints the tail of docs/history/usage_daily.txt - yesterday's and
today's weighted spend judged against the previous 7 active days, with
the verdict. --no-usage skips the refresh (no transcripts, no time).

PURPOSE: Prints the post pull standup digest: the last exchange mined from
  harness transcripts, the day file's WHERE WE LEFT OFF, the usage budget
  line, THE LOOP (each run_all group's age), ledger trend proposals, version
  and recent commits, THE CORE (check_claude_md.py's OK/WARN line, run as a
  subprocess so the owner sees the core's size every session), WS notes
  from docs/index/notes.md, ledger tails, the open roadmap index, and OPEN
  QUESTIONS TO MAZHRON.
INTENT: the CEO 2026-09-02: 'this goes along with my rules of creating a
  script for everything.'
