"""LAW GAPS: two cheap checks for laws no other script measures (the CEO's
ruling 2026-09-29, asked whether three unmeasured laws should get ledgers):
"Generally the rule is that everything that can be measured should be, or
else we can't learn from it. It's just dust in the wind. Make the call, if
we can learn from it, and it doesn't increase our token costs by any
significant amount, yes."

    python tools/law_gaps.py              # runs both checks, prints both lines
    python tools/law_gaps.py --selftest    # exercises the pure parsers, no git, no ledgers

CHECK A, THE ARCHIVE SWEEP: parses docs/index/notes.md for actioned notes
that have not yet moved to docs/systems/history.md.
CHECK B, THE WORKFLOW RULE (a proxy): parses 30 days of git log for changed
tool files not named anywhere in WORKFLOWS.md.

The manager's call left a third candidate, the contradiction rule, out on
purpose: it cannot be measured cheaply by script.

PURPOSE: Ledger two proxies for laws no other script measures: notes.md
  entries actioned but not swept to history.md, and tools changed in 30
  days that no WORKFLOWS.md entry names.
INTENT: the CEO's ruling 2026-09-29 (quoted above): measure what can be
  measured cheaply, so it teaches instead of being dust in the wind; the
  contradiction rule is left out on purpose because it cannot be measured
  by script.

Search keys: archive sweep, workflow gap, law ledgers, unmeasured laws,
notes.md sweep.
See also: docs/index/laws.md "The archive sweep" and "The workflow rule";
docs/index/notes.md; WORKFLOWS.md; tools/run_all.py check group, which the
manager wires.
