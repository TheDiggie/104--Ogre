"""THE CORRECTION LEDGER (the CEO's ruling 2026-09-13: "Lets pretend I ask
you to do something. You build it, and it's wrong. I send you a correction
skill. You then inquire: What about the last thing I did needs correcting?
The user explains. You mark that down and prepare to fix the thing that
needs correcting, then you would ask 'What was the intent?'")

    python tools/correction_log.py --record --actor fable \\
        --shipped "<what was built, 3-10 words>" \\
        --wrong "<the CEO's words, verbatim>" \\
        [--intent-id I0007] [--intent-ref "<INTENT.md heading>"]
    python tools/correction_log.py --fixed C0003 --fix "<commit subject or note>"

    python tools/correction_log.py --last      # newest record
    python tools/correction_log.py --open      # corrections without a FIXED line

THE RECORD: docs/history/corrections.txt, append-only. A RECORD line is
written the moment the correction is understood (the CEO's words, not a
paraphrase); a FIXED line is appended when the fix ships. When the
correction names an intent claim (--intent-id), that claim is resolved
DIFFERENT with source=correction in the intent log by this script - a
correction IS the comparison's hardest evidence, so it never has to be
remembered separately. tools/intent_report.py counts corrections per
day/week/month next to the agreement rates; tools/ledger_trends.py
proposes a law or an INTENT.md entry when corrections cluster.

The /correct skill walks the ritual: ask what needs correcting -> record
-> ask "what was the intent?" -> the /intent skill files the why and
resolves the claim -> fix -> --fixed.

THE PATTERN ROW (2026-09-29, the first reply after the proposal law): when
corrections cluster, ledger_trends.py proposes naming the pattern and
drafting its law; --pattern appends a PATTERN line (ids, the law's name,
the INTENT.md ref) so the proposal stops re-firing on a count that stays
high for seven days. It fires again only when a RECORD lands after the
newest PATTERN line - a new correction reopens the question.

PURPOSE: Record the correction ledger: a RECORD line the moment a correction
  is understood in the CEO's own words, a FIXED line when the fix ships, and
  resolve the named intent claim as DIFFERENT in the intent log when one is
  given.
INTENT: the CEO's ruling 2026-09-13: Lets pretend I ask you to do something.
  You build it, and it's wrong. I send you a correction skill. You then
  inquire: What about the last thing I did needs correcting? The user
  explains. You mark that down and prepare to fix the thing that needs
  correcting, then you would ask What was the intent?
