"""Guards the CLAUDE.md token diet (2026-08-24 restructure).

    python tools/check_claude_md.py

Warns (exit 1) when the lean core bloats past its budget or the library
index drifts from the files on disk. Run it whenever CLAUDE.md grows; the
answer to a warning is moving knowledge into docs/systems/, never raising
the budget casually.

PURPOSE: Read CLAUDE.md and fail with exit 1 when the pointer core exceeds its
  token or line budget, when CLAUDE.md does not name the master index, when
  the master index (docs/index/MASTER_INDEX.md) drifts from the docs/systems
  and docs/index files on disk, or when a .claude/rules file has no paths
  field (it would load every session; its tokens count against the core);
  warn past WARN_TOKENS.
INTENT: keeps CLAUDE.md lean from the 2026-08-24 token diet restructure by
  catching bloat and index drift the moment they happen, instead of letting
  the file grow back into old habits. THE TOKEN BUDGET (the CEO 2026-09-14,
  after a Reddit reader measured the kit's front door at ~5k tokens): the
  core is the one file loaded whole every session, so its size is judged in
  tokens (bytes/4, the digest_size rule) and the answer to a FAIL is
  tools/core_diet.py (route a section, let the loop move it), never a
  raised budget. THE POINTER CORE (the CEO 2026-09-14, after reading
  Anthropic's memory doc: "Claude.md should simply point to everything
  else"): the line budget is Anthropic's 200, the token budget 2,000 is
  the CEO's action line, the warn line 1,000 is the community figure;
  rules only load by path, the master index is the one door.

See also: CLAUDE.md (the file guarded), docs/index/MASTER_INDEX.md (the one
  door checked), docs/systems/ + docs/index/ (the files it must list),
  .claude/rules/ (paths checked), tools/core_diet.py (the mover that
  answers a budget FAIL), tools/standup.py (prints the OK/WARN line),
