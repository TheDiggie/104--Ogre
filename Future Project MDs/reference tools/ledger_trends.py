"""Ledger trends -> PROPOSALS: the learning loop's closing step, read-only.

the CEO's ask 2026-09-10 ("Is Rootstock implementing learning loops?"):
the ledgers already MEASURE (usage, tests, links, heat, employees,
compactions); this script reads their tails, compares them with the
THRESHOLDS below and prints proposed rule changes for the owner. It never
applies anything - a proposal is a sentence at standup, and the owner
decides. Standup calls it after THE BUDGET; run it alone any time.

Proposals (each names its ledger and the number that crossed):
  usage_daily.txt   >= N CHECK verdicts in the last 7 lines -> the read
                    diet is slipping; a rising whole-file-read average
  test_runs.txt     >= N FAIL lines in the last 10 -> a flaky group
  wiki_link_runs.txt  dead links > 0 -> fix them (the list is in
                    wiki_links.txt)
  wiki_heat_runs.txt  ACTIVE-UNREAD cold sections >= N -> propose a heading
                      check (cold by read count alone is never a shelf
                      reason - the CEO 2026-09-10; see wiki_heat WHY COLD)
  usage_daily.txt     read-diet CHECKs and big reads point at
                      docs/history/big_reads.txt (per-file, with the fix)
                    (candidates in wiki_heat.txt; nothing moves without
                    the owner's word)
  SUBAGENTS.md ledger  a model's CORRECTED+FAILED share > 25% of its last
                    10 lines -> the escalation rule (SUBAGENTS rule 6)
  compact_runs.txt  >= N compactions in the last 7 days -> checkpoint
                    earlier
  readme_audit_runs.txt  >= N kit-folder commits or >= N days since the last
                    README audit -> run the four-employee cross-reference
                    (tools/readme_audit.py; the lint is the mechanical layer)
  delete_grants.txt / retired_files.txt  informational counts
  11. open_questions.txt  an OPEN question waited past open_question_days ->
                    ask the CEO or resolve it
  12. digest_size.txt   the newest standup digest exceeds digest_warn_bytes ->
                    trim a tail or split a block
  13. loop_runs.txt     a run_all group's last run is older than its entry
                    in loop_stale_days -> the loop law says the main loop
                    calls it; check the session_start hook
When the set of proposals differs from the last run's, one line goes to
docs/history/proposal_runs.txt so the loop has its own history.

THE THRESHOLDS FILE (the CEO's ruling 2026-09-14): these numbers are
proposal-only - nothing here refuses a tool call or protects anything, so
they are NOT safety wiring (unlike the diet guard's constants, which stay
in code). DEFAULTS below are the script's; the owner's tuned numbers live
in .claude/trend_limits.json (COMMITTED, mirrors .claude/fanout_limits.json),
read fresh on every call. `--limits` prints the effective value and its
source (default/json) for every key.

PURPOSE: Reads the tails of the project's history ledgers (usage, tests,
  wiki links, wiki heat, employee corrections, compactions, README audit,
  intent claims, corrections, systems audit, open questions, digest size,
  the run_all loop, the lesson loop), compares them against tunable
  thresholds, and prints proposed rule changes, each tagged [DO] (a
  script, hook or employee carries it out in the reply that reads it) or
  [ASK] (only the owner can answer); it applies nothing itself.
INTENT: the CEO's ask 2026-09-10: 'Is Rootstock implementing learning
  loops?' Extended 2026-09-14: open questions get a nudge past N days, and
  the thresholds move to a data file the owner tunes (security and cost/
  efficiency come first; these numbers carry neither, so they are safe to
  externalize).

Search keys: learning loop, proposals, ledger trends, thresholds, rule
change proposal, standup proposals, escalation, cold shelf sweep, open
questions nudge, digest size, loop staleness, trend limits.
