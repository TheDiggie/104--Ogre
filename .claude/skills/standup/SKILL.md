# /standup - the session opener

PURPOSE: Open a session: print the standup digest and hand back the last
  exchange (prompt and response) and project state before anything else.
INTENT: The script mines the true final exchange from the harness
  transcript, ground truth on disk, so after a clear the owner has nothing
  and this gives it back unprompted, even after a mid-arc clear.

1. If a [HOOK session_start] block is already in context, the digest
   was injected automatically - do NOT run the script again. Otherwise
   run `python tools/standup.py` from the repo root.
2. Relay THE LAST EXCHANGE block FIRST and VERBATIM: the user's last
   prompt AND the manager's last response exactly as the script prints
   them, word for word in quote blocks - never summarized, condensed, or
   paraphrased (the user must recognize their own words). The script mines
   these from the HARNESS TRANSCRIPT (ground truth on disk), so they are
   the true final exchange even after a mid-arc /clear - trust the script's
   block over the day file's checkpoint-time copy. Then relay state and
   next-likely from WHERE WE LEFT OFF. After a /clear the user has nothing -
   give it back unprompted.
3. Then THE BUDGET block: relay its last line or two (yesterday and
   today so far: weighted spend vs the previous 7 active days, top
   pillar, cache misses, reads). A CHECK verdict is relayed VERBATIM -
   it names what went wrong (spend, misses, heavy whole-file reads); a
   LOW spend line is good news worth one sentence.
4. Then summarize the rest of the digest briefly: version, open roadmap
   items, ledger tails worth noting, anything blocked.
5. End by asking what to work on, or naming the next-likely step.

RULES
- Never re-read notes/day files wholesale when the digest covers them;
  open a full file only where the digest points.
- Never re-run green tests at an unchanged version (trust the ledger).

IF THE SCRIPT IS MISSING (new project): this project lacks the reporting
kit. Ask the user for their future-project kit (SKILLS.md + REPORTING_METHOD.md
carry the bootstrap) before improvising a summary.

Search keys: session start, standup, resume after clear, where we left off.
