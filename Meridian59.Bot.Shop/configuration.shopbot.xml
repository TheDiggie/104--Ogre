    OFFERLIST:    
      Add an <item ... /> entry for each TYPE of item you want to sell.
      Do not add item types twice, not even for non-stackable ones.
      If you want to sell 5 helm, you still need one <item ... /> entry.
      
    NAME:
      Make sure the name you provide is 100% correct, otherwise
      the item is not recognized.
      Take care of plural (s) endings and special chars (-) etc.
      Example: 
        Wrong:   "inky-cap mushrooms" 
        Correct: "Inky-cap mushroom"
      
    COUNT: 
      An item will be sold to others, until
      your inventory has reached 'count' of it.
      Ex. 1) Set it to 0, if you want to sell all you have (including ones you might auto-buy).
      Ex. 2) Set it to 20, if you want to keep at least 20 units yourself (sells the other N-20, or none if N < 20).
      
    UNITPRICE:
      This is always the price for one unit of the item.
      For stackable items it's the price for one of the stack.
      For single items it's the price for one item.
      Ex. 1) Selling 1 item-stack of 100 mushroom at unitprice of 10 gives you 1000sh
      Ex. 2) Selling 5 helm items at unitprice of 200 gives you 1000sh

    COUNT: 
      An item will be bought from others, until
      your inventory has reached 'count' of it.      
      Ex. 1) Setting it to 10 and having none of it makes your bot buy 10 of it.
      Ex. 2) Setting it to 50 and already having 45 of it in inventory makes your bot buy 5 of it.

      Ex. 1) Buy 1 item-stack of 100 mushroom at unitprice of 10 costs you 1000sh
