"""THE INTENT REPORT (the CEO's ruling 2026-09-13: agreement between Claude's
intent and the CEO's, "kept track of by day, week, month, like every other
ledger... in txt for you and your employees and a csv/xcl file for a human
to read... audited by script and compared as cheaply as possible").

    python tools/intent_report.py          # regenerate the three outputs + one ledger line

Reads docs/history/intent_log.txt (claims + resolutions, newest line per
id wins) and docs/history/corrections.txt (RECORD lines). Writes:
  docs/history/intent_metrics.txt   for Claude + employees: the SUMMARY block
                                    (all-time, last 7 days vs the 7 before,
                                    the TREND verdict), then day / week /
                                    month tables per actor
  docs/history/intent_metrics.csv   the same rows, one table, for a human
  docs/history/intent_metrics.xlsx  the spreadsheet (openpyxl; skipped
                                    quietly without it) - THE SPREADSHEET
                                    RULE: header frozen, TOTAL rows bold
  docs/history/intent_runs.txt      ONE line per run (append-only): claims,
                                    resolved, agreement %, different %,
                                    pending, corrections, the trend - what
                                    ledger_trends and standup read

THE NUMBERS. agreement = (SAME + SIMILAR) / resolved; different = DIFFERENT
/ resolved; both per period and per actor (fable = manager; an employee's
model name otherwise). THE TREND compares the last 7 days' agreement
against the previous 7 active days (and the last 30 vs the 30 before, as
a second reading): IMPROVING when it rose by TREND_POINTS or more, DECLINING
when it fell by that much, STEADY between, and "n/a (fewer than MIN_RESOLVED
resolved)" while the data is thin - a verdict on three lines is a coin
flip, and the whole point is REAL data. Every number is a count of
recorded verdicts, nothing estimated; "inferred" sources are counted
separately so a self-judged SAME never hides inside a stated one.

Why a script (INTENT.md "Intent tracking", the CEO's words): it is the
same every time, it is cheap and costs no tokens, and it is structured
and triggers from the loop we already have - run_all's metrics group.

PURPOSE: Read the intent log and the correction ledger and regenerate the
  day, week and month agreement metrics as txt, csv and xlsx, plus one run
  ledger line, with a trend verdict of improving, steady or declining.
INTENT: the CEO's ruling 2026-09-13: kept track of by day, week, month, like
  every other ledger, in txt for you and your employees and a csv or xcl
  file for a human to read, audited by script and compared as cheaply as
  possible.

Search keys: intent metrics, agreement rate, same similar different,
intent trend, improving declining, intent spreadsheet, feedback loop.
