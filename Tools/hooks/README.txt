Rootstock hooks (kit v1.30). Install per HOOKS_METHOD.md 'Bootstrap':

PURPOSE: Installation notes for the Rootstock hooks folder: what each hook
  file needs filled in or wired (bash_guard.py's PROJECT RULES,
  fanout_guard.py's numbers via the runaway skill, hygiene_guard.py's CONFIG
  block) and the gitignore entries a new project needs.
INTENT: gives a receiving project the exact per-hook setup steps so the kit
  installs correctly instead of by trial and error.
  tools/hooks/  <- these .py files (bash_guard.py: fill PROJECT RULES)
  .claude/settings.json  <- settings.json (merge if one exists)
  .gitignore  <- .claude/hooks_state.json, .claude/settings.local.json,
                 .claude/fanout_state.json, .claude/diet_state.json,
                 .claude/verify_state.json
The scripts import the checkpoint script from the folder above them
(reference tools/checkpoint.py carries work_fingerprint + hook state).
fanout_guard.py (Tier 2b, the catastrophe-only circuit breaker): keep
its DEFAULTS, run `python tools/hooks/fanout_guard.py --selftest`, wire
its every-tool PreToolUse entry. It refuses only a burst or flood of
sub-agent spawns or runaway token velocity (all self-clearing) and
warns on the rest; nothing for the CEO to type. The CEO tunes the
numbers through the /runaway skill (skills/runaway): `--limits` shows,
`--set key=value` writes .claude/fanout_limits.json - COMMIT that file,
it is the CEO's setting and travels with the repo.
diet_guard.py (Tier 2c, kit v1.12; INDEX FIRST kit v1.15): nothing to
fill in. Wire its Read|Bash|PowerShell PreToolUse entry (settings.json
has it) and run `python tools/hooks/diet_guard.py --selftest`. It refuses
exactly once: the FIRST whole read of a file past ~10k tokens per session
comes back as the file's own index; the same call repeated passes with a
warning. Everything else is warn-only: a file's size before a later big
read, the missing limiter on a chatty shell command.
preserve_guard.py (Tier 2d, kit v1.14, a REFUSAL): nothing to fill in.
Wire its Bash|PowerShell|Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit PreToolUse
entry (settings.json has it), run `python tools/hooks/preserve_guard.py
--selftest`, gitignore .claude/delete_grant.json. It refuses delete
verbs (bare names, pipelines, mirror verbs included), work-discarding
git verbs (force pushes included), deletion calls written into scripts,
and (v1.27) any untracked script a command executes that carries a
deletion shape - read before it runs, whatever wrote it; a variable
target is refused outright; the session scratchpad and prose files pass; one command
passes per grant recorded by reference tools/delete_grant.py (the
CEO's two acknowledgments, verbatim). Movers that replace deletion:
reference tools/retire.py (files) and reference tools/cold_shelf.py
(wiki sections). Audit the project's existing scripts for deletion
calls when installing and bring each to the CEO.
hygiene_guard.py (Tier 3, kit v1.16, the first PostToolUse hook):
rewrite its CONFIG block for the project (the portable MD names, the
kit folder, the skills/hooks dirs, the core file + its lint command,
the wiki dirs to lint, the player-text patterns, the assets folder),
wire its Write|Edit|MultiEdit PostToolUse entry (settings.json has it),
run `python tools/hooks/hygiene_guard.py --selftest`. No state file.
After every edit it says the law that applies to that file: refresh the
kit copy (and the public README), add the missing See-also line, fix a
forbidden character in player-facing text (the one BLOCK), run the
import after a new asset. The /preserve skill (skills/preserve) is the
preservation law's front: retire, shelve, or the twice-acknowledged
delete grant, in that order.
format_guard.py (Tier 3b, kit v1.19, a REFUSAL and a BLOCK): nothing to
fill in; it imports reference tools/format_lint.py (copy that to tools/
first and adapt its CONFIG block: kit folder, hooks/skills dirs,
settings path). Wire BOTH entries from settings.json (PreToolUse and
PostToolUse on Write|Edit|MultiEdit), run `python tools/hooks/format_guard.py
--selftest`. Before an edit of a settings file it refuses one that would
unwire, narrow or mis-point a SAFETY hook (or not parse); after an edit
of any kit thing it blocks one that leaves the thing without its header
(PURPOSE / INTENT / Search keys / See also) and names the rewrite
command. Add the settings-file rule to bash_guard.py (the kit copy has
it in GENERIC RULES) and the Stop twin from stop_tick.py. Then run
`python tools/format_lint.py` once: every tool and hook it names gets
its header by `--rewrite` after a read-only look, never by hand; and
`python tools/purpose_audit.py` creates FLAGS.md for the first audit
(see CONTRIBUTING.md and skills/flag).

THE LOOP LAW (kit v1.21, 2026-09-14): session_start.py runs the parent
loop's session group (reference tools/run_all.py) once a day before the
digest and ledgers the digest's size (digest_size.txt); stop_tick.py warns
CHANGELOG UNEXPORTED when commits sit past a changelog anchor (silent
without one; since v1.31 the export's own "changelog:" commit never
counts, and the line is an order to the manager - THE HOOK LAW, run the
export in that reply). A project without run_all.py gets a one-line note, never a
failure. Both hooks' --selftest cover the new paths.
THE CHECKPOINT NAMED CHECK (kit v1.34): stop_tick.py also refuses once
per prompt when the reply names a checkpoint as due (next / natural /
due / advised / should / now near the word) without the safe-to-clear
marker; it reads the reply from the transcript through reference
tools/lesson_log.py, so copy that beside it. Nothing to fill in.
THE PROPOSAL NAMED CHECK (kit v1.35): stop_tick.py also refuses once per
prompt when the reply names a standup proposal tagged [DO] (the systems
audit, the README audit, the digest trim, a stale loop group, dead
links, an unwritten lesson, a stale claim) while reference
tools/ledger_trends.py still raises it; doing it clears the ledger and
the second Stop passes. It imports ledger_trends, so copy that beside
lesson_log.py. session_start.py's preamble names the law ([DO] lines
are the first reply's work, [ASK] lines are questions). Nothing to fill in.

lesson_advisor.py (Tier 1, kit v1.26, THE LESSON LOOP, a once-per-slice
REFUSAL): nothing to fill in. Copy LESSONS.md to the project root (keep
the law and the entry shape at its top; retire the origin's entries or
keep the ones that carry), copy reference tools/lesson_log.py to tools/,
wire its Stop entry (settings.json has it, beside stop_tick.py), gitignore
.claude/lesson_state.json, run `python tools/hooks/lesson_advisor.py
--selftest` and `python tools/lesson_log.py --selftest`, add
`["tools/lesson_log.py", "--check"]` to run_all's check group. After a
turn that showed trial and error it refuses to end the turn once with
LESSON ADVISED; the manager writes the LESSONS.md entry and ends the turn.
prompt_gauge.py carries the other end (THE LESSON LINE): a prompt whose
words hit an entry's Keys line gets the entry named before the first
tool call. Pipe-test once for real: echo '{"transcript_path": "<a
transcript .jsonl>"}' | python tools/hooks/lesson_advisor.py.
THE ROUTE LINE (kit v1.33): copy reference tools/route_index.py to
tools/ beside lesson_log.py; prompt_gauge.py imports it and prints ROUTE
with the WORKFLOWS.md entries and the tools whose heading, WHEN line or
Search keys the prompt hits, two of each at most. It needs a WORKFLOWS.md
whose `## ` entries carry a WHEN: line and tools whose docstrings carry
Search keys (the format law); silent otherwise. `python
tools/route_index.py --match "<prompt>"` shows what it would say.

THE DELEGATION TRUTH SET (Tier 4a, kit v1.30, three hooks): nothing to
fill in. brief_guard.py (PreToolUse on Agent|Task, a REFUSAL): a dispatch
to a work agent type whose brief is missing the stamp template, the
INTENT line, the budget line or the preservation line is refused with
the pieces named; read-only searcher types (Explore, Plan) pass.
delegation_auditor.py (PostToolUse on Agent|Task): reads the
harness-metered tool/token figures out of every sub-agent result - 0
metered calls on a work task is the fabrication tell, a TOOLS-line
mismatch and a malformed report warn - and appends one PENDING line per
work delegation to docs/history/delegation_pending.txt. verify_advisor.py
(Stop, a once-per-set REFUSAL): a PENDING id with no later `RESOLVED |
<id>` line refuses the turn end once - verify, ledger, resolve, or say
why not; gitignore .claude/verify_state.json. Wire all three
(settings.json has them; the format guard's SAFETY table holds their
wiring), run each `--selftest`, then pipe-test the loop once for real:
a synthesized Agent result with totalToolUseCount 0 through
delegation_auditor.py, watch verify_advisor.py block, append the
RESOLVED line, watch it pass. The CEO's rule names stay the manager
book's (SUBAGENT_METHOD.md rules 3, 5, 9, 13, 14).

session_end.py (Tier 1 #6, kit v1.28, THE AUTO-CHECKPOINT): nothing to
fill in. Wire its SessionEnd entry (settings.json has it; timeout 55 -
the harness caps SessionEnd at 60 s total). It needs checkpoint.py and
standup.py in tools/ (the reference tools) and, for the mirror push,
tools/backup_push.py with a `backup` remote on each repo (optional: a
missing remote is a skip). Test: `python tools/hooks/session_end.py
--selftest` (18 checks in a throwaway repo under the OS temp folder),
then `echo {"reason":"clear"} | python tools/hooks/session_end.py` on
a clean pushed tree and read docs/history/session_end_runs.txt's tail:
"already checkpointed".
