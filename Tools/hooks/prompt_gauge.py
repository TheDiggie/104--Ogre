"""UserPromptSubmit hook: the context gauge + task counter, every prompt
(Tier 1, #3). SILENT unless a threshold is crossed - zero tokens on a
normal turn. When it speaks, the manager relays the line verbatim
(the CEO's 80% rule 2026-09-04; the 8/15 task thresholds 2026-09-02).

Since 2026-09-20 it also carries THE LESSON LINE (the CEO: "nothing surfaces
a lesson before I start"): the prompt's words are matched against the Keys
line of every LESSONS.md entry (tools/lesson_log.py match_lines) and the
matching headlines, at most three, are printed with their line numbers so the
manager reads the entry before the first tool call; a MATCHED line goes to
docs/history/lesson_runs.txt. Silent on a prompt that hits nothing.

Since 2026-09-13 it also carries THE KIT LINE: "KIT UNSYNCED" while a
portable original is newer than its kit copy or the kit folder is ahead
of the public mirror (tools/refresh_kit.py --check), silent otherwise.

Since 2026-09-28 it also carries THE ROUTE LINE (kit v1.33, after Kelsey
Hightower's Zero Token Architecture: the script rule exports the logic, but
WHICH workflow or script handles a prompt was still inferred every turn):
the prompt's words are matched against every WORKFLOWS.md entry's heading
and WHEN line and every reference tool's Search keys (tools/route_index.py,
the lesson matcher) and the hits, at most two of each, are printed under
ROUTE so the scripted way is checked before it is re-derived. No ledger: a
route is a pointer; the tool it names keeps its own.

Answers `--selftest` (house pattern: PASS/FAIL lines on the pure line
builder, never stdin or a real prompt).

PURPOSE: UserPromptSubmit hook that stays silent on a normal turn and, when
  a threshold is crossed, prints the checkpoint counter warning (8 tasks
  advised, 15 dire) and the context-remaining warning, plus since 2026-09-13
  a KIT UNSYNCED line when a portable original is newer than its kit copy,
  and since 2026-09-20 the LESSONS line naming the LESSONS.md entries whose
  Keys match the prompt, so the one right way is read before the first tool call,
  and since 2026-09-28 the ROUTE line naming the WORKFLOWS.md entries and the
  reference tools whose heading, WHEN line or Search keys the prompt hits.
INTENT: relays the checkpoint and context thresholds and the kit-sync check
  at zero cost on a normal turn, so the manager checkpoints or refreshes the
  kit only when the harness itself has detected the need.

Search keys: prompt hook, context gauge, 80 percent rule, task counter,
kit unsynced, lessons line, lesson loop, route line, which script.
See also: tools/checkpoint.py (thresholds + the transcript probe);
tools/hooks/stop_tick.py (the tick that feeds the counter); tools/lesson_log.py
(match_lines); tools/route_index.py (the route line); LESSONS.md; WORKFLOWS.md.
