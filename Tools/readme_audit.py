"""THE README AUDIT LEDGER (the CEO 2026-09-13, the third layer of "prevent
the README falling behind": the lint catches drift in facts a script can
derive; only an AUDIT catches an answer we know that the README never
says).

    python tools/readme_audit.py                 # status: last audit, what moved since
    python tools/readme_audit.py --record "<summary>"   # ledger a finished audit

An audit is the manager's four-employee cross-reference (read-only
employees compare the public README against every method file, the
skills, the hooks and the front door; the manager applies the findings).
When one finishes, `--record` appends one line to
docs/history/readme_audit_runs.txt with the date, workstation, kit
version, and how many kit-folder commits landed since the previous
audit. tools/ledger_trends.py reads the tail and PROPOSES a fresh audit
at standup when the kit has moved past a threshold of commits or days
since the last line (readme_audit_kit_commits / readme_audit_days in its
THRESHOLDS - the owner's numbers). Nothing runs an audit by itself.

PURPOSE: Keeps the README audit ledger: prints status (last audit date, days
  since, kit folder commits since) and on --record appends one line to
  docs/history/readme_audit_runs.txt recording a finished four employee
  cross reference of the public README.
INTENT: the CEO 2026-09-13, the third layer of 'prevent the README falling
  behind': the lint catches drift in facts a script can derive, only an
  audit catches an answer the README never says.

Search keys: readme audit, audit cadence, readme review, kit audit,
cross-reference audit, unwritten answers.
