"""THE README PARITY LINT (the CEO 2026-09-13: "What can we do to prevent
the Readme from falling behind so far and missing information like that
in the future?" - "Lets build it.")

    python tools/readme_lint.py            # check, ledger a line, exit 1 on FAIL
    python tools/readme_lint.py --quiet    # one summary line only
    python tools/readme_lint.py --selftest # prove the checks bite

The public README (rootstock-os/README.md) lives only in the kit repo and
no script used to read its CLAIMS - only its version line. The 09-13
audit found three slips a version check cannot see: a law count in prose
("six" after the seventh law joined), a wrong destination for
settings.json, and a mechanic described slightly wrong. This lint derives
every countable fact from its SOURCE OF TRUTH in the kit folder and
compares it with what the README says:

  laws          numbered items under SUBAGENT_METHOD.md's laws heading
                (and the heading's own number word must agree)
  skills        the dirs in kit skills/ - count word + every /name named
  hooks         the *.py in kit hooks/ (minus the shared lib) - count word
  reference     the files in "reference tools/" - count word
  the box       every top-level kit entry has a box-table row and every
                row names a real entry (a renamed or retired file shows)
  version       README "Kit version: vX.Y" == UPGRADES.md CURRENT KIT VERSION
  graft README  the newest UPGRADES.md entry carries a README: line naming
                the README section it touched (or "none, wording only")
  number words  ANY "<number word> laws|skills|hooks|hook scripts|rituals|
                working scripts" claim in the README must equal the truth
  claims table  small grep-able facts (CLAIMS below): a regex that must
                match and one that must not - extend it when an audit
                finds a prose slip a count cannot express

tools/sync_kit_repo.py runs this and REFUSES to push on any FAIL; run_all's
check group runs it; each run appends to docs/history/readme_lint_runs.txt.
A machine without the kit clone prints SKIP and exits 0 (a ledger line
says so) - the lint is a publish gate, not a workstation requirement.

PURPOSE: Derives every countable README fact (laws, skills, hooks, reference
  tools, the box table, version, the graft README line, number word claims,
  prose claims) from the kit folder itself and compares it with what the
  public README says, ledgering PASS, FAIL or SKIP each run.
INTENT: the CEO 2026-09-13: 'What can we do to prevent the Readme from
  falling behind so far and missing information like that in the future?'
  'Lets build it.'
